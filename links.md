# LINKS

*Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing*

* Links are created using the \<a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening \<a> tag and the closing \</a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### Email Links:
* mailto:
    * To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the \<a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

### Opening Links in a New Window:
* target:
    * If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
\<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

### Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page:

# LAYOUT
## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
1. Building Blocks: 
    * CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box
2. Containing Elements:
    * If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.



### NORMAL FLOWS AND POSITION:
1. position:static
2. position:relative
3. position:absolute
4. position:fixed

### FLOATING ELEMENTS:
*The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.*
1. left.
2. right.
3. both.
4. none.
