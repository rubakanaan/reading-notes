# LINKS

*Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing*

* Links are created using the \<a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening \<a> tag and the closing \</a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### Email Links:
* mailto:
    * To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the \<a>
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

### Opening Links in a New Window:
* target:
    * If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
\<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

### Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page:

## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
1. Building Blocks: 
    * CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box
2. Containing Elements:
    * If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.



### NORMAL FLOWS AND POSITION:
1. position:static
2. position:relative
3. position:absolute
4. position:fixed

### FLOATING ELEMENTS:
*The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.*
1. left.
2. right.
3. both.
4. none.

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).*

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming:
**Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.**

**More “two heads are better than one” than “stop reading over my shoulder,” pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.**

### How does pair programming work?
**pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.**
