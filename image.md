# PRACTICAL INFORMATION 

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
1. The Basics:
    * Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.
2. On-Page Techniques
    * On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines
3. Off-Page Techniques
    * Getting other sites to link to you
    is just as important as on-page
    techniques. Search engines help
    determine how to rank your
    site by looking at the number of
    other sites that link to yours.

## On-Page SEO:
*In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.*

1. Page Title.
2. URL / Web Address.
3. Headings.
4. Text.
5. Link Text.
6. Image Alt Text.
7. Page Descriptions.


## How to Identify Keywords and Phrases

*Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site*

1. Brainstorm
    * List down the words that
    someone might type into
    Google to find your site. Be sure
    to include the various topics,
    products or services your site is
    about.
    It often helps to ask other people
    what words they would use to
    find your site because people
    less familiar with a topic might
    use different terms than you. (In
    particular, they are less likely to
    use industry-specific jargon.)
    Your list may include some
    keyword phrases (not just
    individual words) if you have
    topics which are described by
    more than one word.
2. Organize
    * Group the keywords into
    separate lists for the different
    sections or categories of your
    website.
    For example, if your website
    was a pet shop you might have
    different categories for different
    animals (such as dogs, cats and
    rabbits).
    On a large site you may
    break this up further into
    sub-categories (for example,
    separate groups for different pet
    food brands).
3. Research
    * There are several tools that let
    you enter your keywords and
    then they will suggest additional
    keywords you might like to
    consider, such as:
    adwords.google.co.uk/
    select/KeywordToolExternal
    (When using this tool, select the
    "exact match" option rather than
    "broad match.")
    www.wordtracker.com
    www.keyworddiscovery.com
    Once these tools have suggested
    additional keywords, add the
    relevant options to your lists.
    (Keyword tools will most likely
    suggest some terms that are
    irrelevant so do omit any that do
    not seem appropriate)
