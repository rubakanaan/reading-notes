# TEXT
*The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups*

### Choosing a Typeface for your Website
When choosing
a typeface, it
is important to
understand that a
browser will usually
only display it if it's
installed on that
user's computer.

*Browsers are supposed to support at least one typeface from each of
the groups above. For this reason, it is common to add the generic font
name after your preferred choice of typefaces.
For example, if you wanted serif type, you could write the following:
font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;*

### Specifying Typefaces
* font-family:The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
* font-size: The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. 
* font-weight: The font-weight property
allows you to create bold text.
* font-style: If you want to create italic text,
you can use the font-style
property.
