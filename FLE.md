* padding: to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content
* text-transform : to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase

* border-top, border-bottom:
to set borders above and below
the table headers
* text-align : to align the writing
to the left of some table cells and
to the right of the others
* background-color :to change
the background color of the
alternating table rows
* :hover : to highlight a table row
when a user's mouse goes over it


# EVENTS
*W hen you browse the web, your browser registers different
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.
Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the
Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. In this chapter, you
will learn how:*

* INTERACTIONS CREATE EVENTS
* EVENTS TRIGGER CODE
* CODE TO RESPONDS USERS
