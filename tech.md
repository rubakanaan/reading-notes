# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry 
<br>
<br>

### Diversity in Tech 
Three takeaways:
<br>

- Certain companies that were reflective of the general population on some fronts were completely not reflective of the population by other measures... So a company may have good diversity by one metric, but often not on the whole
- The FAANG companies were lower on the list (filtering by multiple metrics) than I had expected
- Congress has only 20% women and is 80% white? That is wild. I feel like I knew, that, but seeing it visually is interesting. So I suppose that overall, tech companies have better diversity than congress!

## Why Diversity Matters to Your Tech Company 
<br>
<br>

### When are diversity efforts most successful?
When they come from the top of an organization! If the leaders are 100% committed to the efforts, it is likely that is will become a part of company cultre.
<br>
<br>

### Why do diverse companies perform better?
For teams that work with creativity and innovation, having people from all sorts of backgrounds brought benefits. Different people saw different ways to solve problems. Diversity helps financial outcomes across the board!

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
A company led by someone with a physical disability may be more aware of the challenges different people could run into when using the product. For example- if you were working on designing the Kinect or Wii, it would be helpful to have people working on it who were aware of the physical limitations of some sub-set of consumers.
