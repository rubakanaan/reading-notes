# LISTS IN HTML.

### There are three types of list:
1. Ordered list:  are lists where each item in the list is
numbered.
2. Unordered list: are lists that begin with a bullet point.
3. Definition lists: are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

# BOX IN CSS

### Box Dimensions:
*By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties*

1. BORDER : 
    * Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another
2. MARGIN :
    * Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes
3. PADDING :
    * Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.


### SWITCH STATEMENTS 
 *A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.*
