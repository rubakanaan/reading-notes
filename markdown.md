# What is Markdown ?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters.

1. Headers
   * \# for he1
   * \#\# for h2
2. Emphasis
   * \*word\* for italic
   * \*\*word\*\* for bold
