## What is CSS?
*CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS, it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once and
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files*

## CSS can be added to HTML documents in three ways:

* Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
   * **\<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a Blue Heading\</h1>**
* Internal - by using a \<style> element in the \<head> section.
    * **\<head> <br>
\<style> <br>
body {background-color: powderblue;} <br>
h1   {color: blue;} <br>
p    {color: red;} <br>
\</style> <br>
\</head><br>**
* External - by using a \<link> element to link to an external CSS file
    * **\<head> <br>
  \<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <br>
\</head><br>**

 ## COLOR:

 **The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:**

1. rgb values:
    * These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex codes:
    * These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. color names:
    * There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan
We look at these three different
ways of specifying colors on the
next double-page spread.
CSS3 has also introduced
another way to specify colors
called HSLA.
