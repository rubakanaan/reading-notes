# LOOPS.

**Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.**

## The three most common types of loops are

* for 
    * if you need the code to run a specific number of times.
* while 
    * if you dont know how many times the code should run.
* do while
    * similar to while loop,  but it always will run the code  between the "do" at least once even if the condition is false. 


## EXAMPLES:

1. FOR LOOP:
    * for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) { <br>
  text += "The number is " + i + "\<br>"; <br>
}
2. WHILE LOOP:
    * while (i < 10) {  <br>
  text += "The number is " + i; <br>
  i++; <br>
}
3. DO WHILE LOOP:
    * do { <br>
  text += "The number is " + i; <br>
  i++; <br>
} <br>
while (i < 10); <br>
