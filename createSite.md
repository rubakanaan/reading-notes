# CREATE YOUR WEBSITE.


WHO IS THE SITE FOR?
Whenever you try to create a website you have to ask yourself who is the target audience.

target audience:
1. individuals
   *  What is the age range of your target audience?
   * Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
   * Which country do your visitors live in? 
   * What is their occupation?
   * How many hours do they work per week?
   * How often do they use the web?
   * What kind of device do they use to access the web?

2. Companies
   * What is the size of the company or relevant department?
   * What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
   * Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
   * How large is the budget they control?

## Why People Visit YOUR Website?
you need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users. 


## What Information Your Visitors Need ?

You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively.

### Key Information:
* Will visitors be familiar with
your subject area / brand
or do you need to introduce
yourself?
* Will they be familiar with
the product / service /
information you are covering
or do they need background
information on it?
* What are the most important
features of what you are
offering?
* What is special about what
you offer that differentiates
you from other sites that offer
something similar?


# WireFrames.

## what is wireframes?
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

### example:

# HTML LAYOUTS

html provides a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. 

STANDARD LAYOUTS:
1. header and footer (\<header> ,\<footer>)
* The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
2. Navigation. (\<nav>)
* The \<nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation. 

3. Articles (\<article> )
* The \<article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.


4. Sections (\<section>)
* The \<section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

5. Sectioning Elements (\<div>)
* It may seem strange to follow
these new elements by revisiting
the \<div> element again. (After
all, the new elements are often
going to be used in its place.)

# EXTRA MARKUP

1. COMMENTS (\<!-- -->)
2. ID Attribute (id=""  inside the tag )
3. class Attribute (class=""  inside the tag )
4. INLINE elements (\<em>)
5. Paragraph (\<p>)
6. Anchor (\<a>)
7. images (\<img>)
