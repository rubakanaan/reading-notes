**Lets start with the Difintion of The Growth Mindset:**

*In a growth mindset, you should  believe that most basic abilities can be developed through dedication, effort and hard work, brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
So, you have to embrace challenges, persist through obstacles, learn from criticism and seek out inspiration in othersâ€™ success.*

## always reminde myself  that :
* Failure is an opportunity to grow
* i can learn to do anything they want
* Challenges help me to grow
* Always try new things
