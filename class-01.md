# Introduction to HTML.

## HTML Describes the Structure of Pages:
Here is some tags used to describe the structure of the page:
* each tag has openning and closing.

\<html> this tag indicates that anything between it opennig and a closing  tag is HTML code.<br>
\<body> This tag indicates that anything between it openning and the closing
 tag should be shown inside the main browser window.<br>
 \<h1>This is the Main Heading\</h1> <br>
 \<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of<br>
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might<br>
 be split up into several sub-headings.\<p><br>
 \<h2>This is a Sub-Heading\</h2><br>
 \<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help<br>
 you follow the structure of what is being written.<br>
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level<br>
 headings).\</p><br>
 \<h2>Another Sub-Heading\</h2><br>
 \<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.\</p><br>
\</body><br>
\</html><br>

 **Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.**

## EXTRA MARKUP IN HTML:

1. \<!-- -->
    * If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters
        *  \<!-- comment goes here -->
2. \<id=>
    * Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
        * \<p id="pullquote">
page. 
3. \<class=>
    * Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page. 
        * \<p class="important">
4. \<div>
    * The \<div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box.

## Html Layout Elements:

* *HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them.*

### **Tags and definition:**
1. **\<header> and \<footer>** : The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.

2. **\<nav>** : The \<nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.
3. **\<article>** : The \<article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.

4. **\<section>** : The \<section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

## WIREFRAME:
**A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.**
