## ARRAYS:
*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.*

* You should consider using an
array whenever you are working
with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.
* Arrays are especially helpful
when you do not know how
many items a list will contain
because, when you create the
array, you do not need to specify
how many values it will hold.
<br>
<br>

### CREATING AN ARRAY:
there are multiple way to create an array depends on how you want to use it.
Example:
* var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
* var name = cars[0];
* var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
<br>
<br>
### VALUES IN ARRAY:
*Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one)*

1. **INDEX**:
    * Each item in an array is
automatically given a number
called an index. This can be used
to access specific items in the
array. 

2. **VALUE.**

<br>
<br>
<br>
### ACCESSING AND CHANGING ARRAY'S VALUE;

EXAMPLES:
* This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:
    * cars[0] = "Opel";

* This statement access the third element in the array:
    * fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];  <br>
var first = fruits[2];

<br>
<br>

## FUNCTIONS AND METHODS:
*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).*
 ### FUNCTION SYNTAX:
 
 function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {  <br>
  // code to be executed  <br>
}

* Example:
   * function myFunction(p1, p2) { <br>
  return p1 * p2; <br>
    // The function returns the product of p1 and p2 <br>
}
